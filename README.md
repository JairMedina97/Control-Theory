## Control-Theory
Control theory is one of the classes w/ branches of control that as an automation student I have on my engineering curriculum.

# Intro to Control Theory (IntroCT)
1. Intro to Control systems
2. Mathematical modelling
3. Frequency domain versus time domain
4. Time response: Transient and steady state response
5. Stability
6. Steady state error
7. Root Locus Method
8. Frequency response - Bode plot
